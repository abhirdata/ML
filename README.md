**1. Exploratory Folder**
Topic: Prediction of the outcome of a clinical trial using ML frameworks.

Supervisor: Dr. Ashish Kumar Agrawal, Assistant Professor, Pharmaceutical Engineering and Technology, IIT (BHU), Varanasi.

Description:-
• Employed machine learning techniques to analyze terminated clinical trials, developing a predictive model for trial outcomes.
• Attained a noteworthy 67%+ Balanced Accuracy in predicting trial terminations through various classification models.
• Proposed a predictive framework aiding stakeholders in optimizing trial planning, reducing costs, and boosting success rates.

**2. Internship @ IIM-A Folder**
Topic: A Novel Model using ML techniques for Clinical Trial Design and Expedited Patient Onboarding Process.

Supervisor: Dr. Sundaravalli Narayanswami, Associate Professor, Public Systems Group, IIM Ahmedabad.

Description:-
• Executed a novel ML approach to optimize target site selection and enhance patient enrollment in clinical trials. 
• Analyzed 273,254 studies from ClinicalTrials.gov, creating a robust test bed of 55,000 samples across countries. 
• Achieved 71% balanced accuracy and 0.70 AUC for predicting trial outcomes and 73% test accuracy in automating
patient eligibility assessment for liver-related trials using ensemble methods, neural networks, and NLP techniques.

**3. Inter IIT Tech Meet Kanpur 11.0 Folder**
This contains four files, namely, PS (contains the problem statement), ABSTRACT (contains the 3 ideas proposed to be automated using Bayesian Stats), and
REPORT & PPT (Ideation and plan of execution of the idea selected).

Topic: Decision-Making Model using Bayesian Networks.

Description:-
• Utilized extensive expertise to design an intricate decision-making model tailored to a cutting-edge no-code platform.
• The model designed automates the incentive design process for a company, hence saving time and resources. 
• This model adapts to changing market conditions, producing more impactful and personalized incentive strategies.

The rest of the projects in the repository are just various implementations of different concepts of ML, using a diverse domain of datasets.
